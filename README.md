# GeoImageNet UI

Prototype for GeoImageNet UI
- public landing page with information about the project, benchmarks, etc.
- protected by login platform, with downloadable datasets, interactions with server

# Premise

The goal is to decouple the business domain from the framework being used.
Each framework should route requests to and responses from the GIN package.
Anything under `GIN/` should technically be agnostic of any framework.

# Installation

Run `npm install` from the root of repository

## Environment variables

You can modify the webpack.common.js and webpack.dev.js to modify your local dev environnement

For reference:

- SERVER_PROTOCOL: The protocol to be used for http requests from the client. Defaults to "https://".
- GEOSERVER_URL: The geoserver installation to be used for the client, *without* the /geoserver. Defaults to "geoimagenetdev.crim.ca".
- GEOIMAGENET_API_URL: Url to GeoImageNet api. Defaults to "geoimagenetdev.crim.ca/api/v1".
- ANNOTATION_NAMESPACE_URI: The geoserver namespace uri of the annotation data. Defaults to "geoimagenet.public.crim.ca".
- ANNOTATION_NAMESPACE: The geoserver namespace of the annotation data. Defaults to "GEOIMAGENET_PUBLIC".
- ANNOTATION_LAYER: The geoserver layer configured to accept annotations. Defaults to "annotation".

## Development

Run `npm run dev-server` to launch a dev instance

## Production

Run `npm run prod` to produce a production ready webpack bundle. Note that it will not launch it's own instance. 

You can always install and use the npm library http-server to selfhost it, but GIN compose is setup to directly serve the produced 
bundle, so it is possible to build a new docker image of the frontend to test it with a local instance of the compose repository.
(see script `deploy-frontend.sh` as an example/tool for this purpose)

## Documentation

We use [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org/) to autogenerate documentation for the Javascript portion of the frontend.
The documentation will be generated when building the bundles from npm scripts.

# Open Layers

I just copy pasted the ol-layerswitcher as it lacks the feature of being always visible.
If it gets possible to use the library and configure the layer switcher to stay open in the future,
maybe revisit this idea. For now I just implemented our needs from their code.

# Geoserver

## Current state

There is no need to setup a local geoserver as it is possible to either use the geoimagenetdev.crim.ca's instance (see webpack.common.js)
of deploy the frontend side by side with the 'compose' repository or inside it

## To setup your own geoserver (old)

Geoserver needs the postgis extension to be enabled to support the postgis data stores needed to store the annotations.
On ubuntu `sudo apt install postgis`. Then, in the postgres cli, run `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`.
You might need to connect to the postgres server using `sudo -u postgres psql annotations` to have sufficient permission to create extensions.
We also use uuids in the application, so install the relevant extension using `CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";`

By default, the installation of geoserver goes to `/usr/share/geoserver`. To start it cd into `/usr/share/geoserver/bin`
and run `sh startup.sh`. It should run on `localhost:8080/geoserver`

## Cors

To enable the CORS, needed for the client to interact with geoserver, follow the instructions seen 
[here](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/container.html#enable-cors):

cd into `/usr/share/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF`, edit the config file `vim web.xml`,
uncomment the two filters tagged `<filter-name>cross-origin</filter-name>` then stop and restart the server.

## WFS-T

To support wfs treansactions:
- in WFS services settings, enable 'transactional' option (https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/141047/83943)
- in Data (security section) add a role for anonymous_role to write on the chosen feature type (in this example case, wfs_geom) (https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/258203/83943)

# Selenium

Follow installation instructions from official doc: make sure to install the drivers for desired browsers and make the symlink in /usr/bin/<driver>

# surface vs objet
le point avec rayon autour est surface
le carr√© being dragged est objet (instance)

# i18n

gettext is the de facto system for translatable strings. Using gettext and python conversion tools we can generate .mo files
needed for jinja2 i18n extension

To extract all translatable strings from templates files:

`
$ cd GIN/Templating
$ find . -iname "*.html" | xargs xgettext -L Python --from-code utf-8 -o fr.pot
`

This should find all .html template files (the only files in which we should see gettext invocations)
then run the xgettext command to extract translatable strings from them into fr.pot

Move them manually to locales/<lang>
